# Horse-Racing-Prediction---Optimized-Gambling-Strategy
This is a group project of two. We have collected 10000+ horse-racing records in the past three years with 98 raw features and our random forest model can generate profit of $40K in 3000 races.

There are two jupyter notebook covers the (1)Web scrapt and Data Analysis, (2) Features selection and model construction. 

You might refer the report for the details of the project.
